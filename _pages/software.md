## AugmentedMixing.jl

[AugmentedMixing.jl](https://github.com/jschwiddessen/AugmentedMixing.jl) is a Julia package that implements the *Augmented Mixing Method*, an algorithm for computing high-accuracy primal–dual solutions to large-scale semidefinite programs (SDPs).

It is based on the following preprint:

> Daniel Brosch, **Jan Schwiddessen**, Angelika Wiegele.  
> *The Augmented Mixing Method: Computing High-Accuracy Primal-Dual Solutions to Large-Scale SDPs via Column Updates.*  
> **Preprint**, (2025).  
> — [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20386)

## SDP-S3VM

[SDP-S3VM](https://github.com/jschwiddessen/SDP-S3VM) provides an exact SDP-based algorithm for semi-supervised support vector machines (S3VMs).

It is based on the following paper:

> Veronica Piccialli, **Jan Schwiddessen**, Antonio M. Sudoso.  
> *Optimization meets machine learning: an exact algorithm for semi-supervised support vector machines.*  
> **Mathematical Programming**, Series B, (2024).
