## Software Engineering
- Languages: C/C++, Java, Julia, MATLAB, Python
- Algorithm engineering: design and analysis; benchmarking and profiling; time/space complexity
- High-performance computing in C/C++: parallel programming and multithreading; POSIX threads; OpenMP; MPI; efficient data layouts and structures
- Development practices and tooling: testing and debugging; documentation; Git/GitHub; CI; Linux
- Data and visualization: SQL (indexing basics); matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, Plots.jl, Makie, ggplot2, TikZ/pgfplots

## Mathematical Optimization
- Strong knowledge of algorithms and methods in combinatorial, global, and nonlinear optimization and machine learning (LP, QP, MILP, NLP, SDP)
- Expert in implementing algorithms for large-scale semidefinite programming (SDP) and integrating them into solvers
- Experience writing efficient, hardware-aware C/C++ code using low-level linear algebra routines (BLAS, LAPACK)
- Strong background in building and solving mathematical models, designing heuristics and randomized algorithms, and applying approximation methods such as LP/QP/SDP relaxations
- Worked with CPLEX, Google OR-Tools, Gurobi, JuMP, MOSEK, scikit-learn, SCIP

## Languages & Communication
- German (native); English (fluent; working language for 7+ years); French (basic)
- Professional presentation skills
