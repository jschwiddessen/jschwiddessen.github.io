## Mathematical Optimization, Machine Learning, and AI
- Strong knowledge of algorithms and methods in combinatorial, global, and nonlinear optimization and machine learning (LP, QP, MILP, NLP, SDP). See [SDP-S3VM](/software/#sdp-s3vm), [SRFLP-BB](/software/#srflp-bb), [AugmentedMixing.jl](/software/#augmentedmixingjl), [s3vm-mixing-c](/software/#s3vm-mixing-c)
- Expert in implementing algorithms for large-scale semidefinite programming (SDP) and integrating them into solvers. See [AugmentedMixing.jl](/software/#augmentedmixingjl), [s3vm-mixing-c](/software/#s3vm-mixing-c)
- Experience writing efficient, hardware-aware C/C++ code using low-level linear algebra routines (BLAS, LAPACK). See [s3vm-mixing-c](/software/#s3vm-mixing-c), [SRFLP-BB](/software/#srflp-bb)
- Strong background in building and solving mathematical models, designing heuristics and randomized algorithms, and applying approximation methods. See [SRFLP-BB](/software/#srflp-bb), [mastermind-solver](/software/#mastermind-solver), [AugmentedMixing.jl](/software/#augmentedmixingjl)
- Worked with CPLEX, Google OR-Tools, Gurobi, JuMP, MOSEK, scikit-learn, SCIP. Used across projects on the [Software](/software/) page

## Software Engineering
- Languages: C/C++, Java, Julia, Python
- Algorithm engineering: design and analysis; benchmarking and profiling; time/space complexity
- High-performance computing in C/C++: parallel programming and multithreading; POSIX threads; OpenMP; MPI; efficient data layouts and structures. See [SRFLP-BB](/software/#srflp-bb), [s3vm-mixing-c](/software/#s3vm-mixing-c), [mastermind-solver](/software/#mastermind-solver)
- Development practices and tooling: testing and debugging; documentation; Git/GitHub; CI; Linux. See repositories on the [Software](/software/) page
- Data and visualization: SQL (indexing design); matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, Plots.jl, Makie, ggplot2, TikZ/pgfplots

## Languages & Communication
- German (native); English (fluent; working language for 7+ years); French (basic)
- Professional presentation skills
