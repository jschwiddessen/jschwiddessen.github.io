> ***Algorithms at scale:***  
> ***Performance you can measure***

I design and ship **efficient algorithms** that power **high-performance optimization software** at **large scale**.

**In practice, that means:**
- Making intractable problems practical
- Measuring impact in runtime, memory, and accuracy
- Applying approximation to tame complex, large-scale systems
- Leveraging computational geometry and mathematical programming
- Shipping efficient, robust open-source code

I’m a PhD candidate in **mathematical** optimization at the University of Klagenfurt (Austria). See [**Publications**](/publications/) and [**Talks**](/talks/) for papers and slides, and [**Software**](/software/) for focus areas and projects.
