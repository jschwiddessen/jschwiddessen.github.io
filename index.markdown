> ***Algorithms at scale &mdash; approximation that makes hard problems practical***

I develop **efficient algorithms** that power **high-performance optimization software** at **large scale**.

**In practice, that means:**
- Pushing the boundaries by making intractable problems practical.
- Gaining measurable impact in terms of runtime, memory, and accuracy.
- Applying approximation methods to gain control over complex, large-scale systems.
- Leveraging computational geometry and mathematical programming.
- Shipping efficient and robust open-source code.

I’m a PhD candidate in **mathematical** optimization at the University of Klagenfurt (Austria). Publications and slides are listed in [**Publications**](/publications/) and [**Talks**](/talks/).

See [**Software**](/software/) for focus areas and projects.
