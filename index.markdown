I am a PhD candidate in **mathematical optimization** at the University of Klagenfurt, Austria.  

My research focuses on designing and implementing algorithms for challenging optimization problems, with emphasis on
- **Semidefinite programming (SDP)** and its applications in combinatorial optimization, global optimization, and machine learning,  
- the development of **efficient algorithms** for large-scale optimization problems,  
- the **implementation of SDP-based solvers** for both theoretical and real-world applications.  

To ensure speed and scalability, I primarily develop solvers in the programming languages **C** and **Julia**.

You can find more details about my work in [**Publications**](/publications/) and [**Software**](/software/).

Slides of my presentations are available on the [**Talks**](/talks/) page.
