I design and implement **efficient algorithms** to build **high-performance optimization software** for **large-scale** problems.

Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in **mathematical** optimization at the University of Klagenfurt (Austria) and open to industry roles in **software engineering**, algorithms, and optimization.

See [**Interests**](/interests/) and [**Software**](/software/) for focus areas and projects.

Publications and slides are listed in [**Publications**](/publications/) and [**Talks**](/talks/).
